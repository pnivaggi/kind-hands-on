# Getting Started

This lab is based on `kind` Kubernetes installer. `kind` or **k**ubernetes **in** **d**ocker is a suite of tooling for local Kubernetes ‚Äúclusters‚Äù where each ‚Äúnode‚Äù is a Docker container. `kind` is targeted at testing Kubernetes and is also very convenient for trainings.
`kind` is divided into go packages implementing most of the functionality, a command line for users, and a ‚Äúnode‚Äù base image. Please refer to <https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/> for more information.

## Task 1. Define Kubernetes Cluster config file

Create a cluster configuration file defining a cluster with one control plane node and two worker nodes.

```bash
tee -a kind-config.yaml <<EOF                           
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
- role: worker
EOF
```

## Task 2. Deploy Kubernetes cluster

Install a Kubernetes cluster named `demo` with `kind` CLI refering to the `kind-config.yaml` configuration file. `kind` CLI is already installed in the lab environement.

```bash
kind create cluster --name demo --config kind-config.yaml
```

You should have an output similar to:

```console
Creating cluster "demo" ...
 ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.25.0) üñº 
 ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶ üì¶ üì¶  
 ‚úì Writing configuration üìú 
 ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è 
 ‚úì Installing CNI üîå 
 ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ 
 ‚úì Joining worker nodes üöú 
Set kubectl context to "kind-demo"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-demo

Have a nice day! üëã
```

## Task 3. Check the cluster with Kind CLI

```bash
kind get clusters
```

```bash
kind get nodes --name demo
```

You should have a similar output.

```
demo-control-plane
demo-worker
demo-worker2
```

## Task 4. Check Kubectl config and current context

```bash
kubectl config current-context
```

```bash
kubectl config view
```

You should have a similar output.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: DATA+OMITTED
    server: https://127.0.0.1:61353
  name: kind-demo
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: kind-demo
    user: kind-demo
  name: kind-demo
current-context: kind-demo
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: kind-demo
  user:
    client-certificate-data: REDACTED
    client-key-data: REDACTED
```

## Task 6. Check the cluster with Kubectl

`kubectl` command line interface is already installed in your lab environment. You can use `kubectl` to check the cluster has been deployed properly

```bash
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-demo
```

You should have a similar output.

```
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:42563
CoreDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:42563/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
```

```bash
kubectl get nodes 
```

You should have the similar output. Notice the ready state for the 3 nodes, 1 control plane and 2 workers.

```console
NAME                 STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
demo-control-plane   Ready    control-plane   11m   v1.25.0
demo-worker          Ready    <none>          11m   v1.25.0
demo-worker2         Ready    <none>          11m   v1.25.0
```

## Task 5. Check the cluster with Docker

You can use `docker` command line interface to list the containers running on the lab environment.

```bash
docker ps
```

You should have a similar output. Notice the image release used for the nodes running as containers: `kindest/node:v1.25.0`

```console
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                       NAMES
6fbf0bfd2ddb   kindest/node:v1.25.0   "/usr/local/bin/entr‚Ä¶"   16 minutes ago   Up 16 minutes                               demo-worker
1e2094700a37   kindest/node:v1.25.0   "/usr/local/bin/entr‚Ä¶"   16 minutes ago   Up 16 minutes                               demo-worker2
a7275fc08a88   kindest/node:v1.25.0   "/usr/local/bin/entr‚Ä¶"   16 minutes ago   Up 16 minutes   127.0.0.1:61353->6443/tcp   demo-control-plane
```

## Task 7. Check the Pods already deployed

Enter the below `kubectl` command to list all the Pods deployed on the cluster

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

You should have a similar output.

```console
NAMESPACE            NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
