# Workloads

## PODs

A Pod is a single instance of an application and the smallest object you can create with Kubernetes. They have a 1-to-1 relationship with the container supporting the application, to scale up you deploy new Pods and to scale down you delete some Pods. A single Pod can have multiple containers in general not of the same kind. Helper containers are deployed in the same Pod as the App container to offload part of the processing from it like accessing files or remote database. The containers in a same Pod share the same network namespace and can communicate to each other via localhost.

### Task 1. Check Pods

Use the following command to check the list of Pods in the default and kube-system namespaces:

```bash

```
